## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App 1: Apple Books
~ Syncretization across different devices
~ Night mode to avoiding straining your eyes

App 2: Spotify
~ Having personalized/"For You" playlists
~ Offline listening/being able to download songs

App 3: Amazon
~ Customer reviews and ratings to learn more about products
~ 1-Click makes ordering items easier and more efficient

App Idea: Fitness App that provides nutritional meals, mental wellness resources and workout plans. Using the app, users can access their workouts and save their progress. With a tab about nutrition, users can find meal ideas for their fitness journey. The app will also include support for mental health by having the user track their sleep, journal, etc.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

While there weren't any real challenges I encountered while building the app, it took a little while for me to adjust to using a storyboard interface.
